# Idaho-Streams-Flux-Stake
The Idaho Streams Flux Stake is a microcontroller based device that can be used to collect long term streambed data while allowing for intermediate data retrieval without disturbing the long term data collection.

The ISF stake is used to collect temperature data at multiple depths below the streambed surface.  The stake package is a 1 3/8‚Äù diameter sealed PVC stake.  It is embedded into the streambed with temperature sensors at multiple depths, potentially with the top sensor above the streambed.  Figure B.1 shows a ISF stake installation.  A LiIon cell and onboard memory is utilized to power data collection over multiple seasons without intervention.  In addition, data, either intermediate or final data, can be collected from an ISF stake utilizing Wifi data transfer to an Android phone app.  Intermediate data transfer is accomplished without removing or disturbing the installed ISF stake.  To accomplish the two functions described, the stake consists of a section containing multiple sensors, and a section containing a microcontroller, LiIon cell, Wifi capability, Wifi switch and an on/off switch.  Figure B.2 highlights the various functional areas of the ISF stake.  Figure B.3 is a screenshot of the data retrieval phone app.  Figure B.4 shows part of the raw data file ready for further processing.  The University of Idaho ISF stake design system provides a robust solution to study streambed behavior.
